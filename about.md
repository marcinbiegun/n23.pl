I'm a pragmatic engineer  with experience in building and delivering
Ruby on Rails MVPs and scalable Ruby microservices. I'm familiar with
deploying and maintaning applications on Linux severs and writing
front-end interfaces using Backbone.js and React.js.

Recently I'm learning QuartzComposer, Vuo, Cyril and other tools for coding
engaging 3D animations.
